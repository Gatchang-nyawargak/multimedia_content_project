            <p>Susanâ€™s passion for data analysis stems
                 from a natural ability to solve puzzles and translate complex information into
                  clear narratives. The field of technology allows her to leverage this skillset
                   and empower businesses. Simplifying and making complex data easy to understand 
                   and act upon is a third eye she is eager to share with the world. Susan is excited 
                   to work in teams to help businesses make smarter, informed decisions and transform 
                   complex datasets into actionable insights. With her commitment to continuous learning,
                    technical proficiency, and a blend of problem-solving skills, Susan is excited to 
                    explore the data space and explore data that turns into art through this fascinating
                     realm with endless possibilities.</p></div>
