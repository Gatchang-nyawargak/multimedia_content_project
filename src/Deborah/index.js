            <h2><b>Personal Statement</b></h2>
            <p>Since childhood, competing in online games,
             Deborah has firsthand experience of the immense pressure gamers face, particularly 
             in esports. The fear of making mistakes under the spotlight can be paralyzing. As an
              entry-level software developer, she is eager to apply her skills to address these 
              specific challenges. She is particularly excited about creating tools that assist 
              gamers in managing anxiety during high-pressure matches. She pictures a program that
               monitors their statistics and composes strategic decisions in the heat of the moment.
                She aims to empower gamers like her to perform their best, shedding the fear of failure
                 and focusing on enjoying the game.</p></div>
